    <p>Let's just say we're related Biff, and that being the case I got a little present for you. (During the following Marty peers up from the back of the car to witness what's going on - he is not seen.) Something that'll make you rich. You wanna be rich, don't ya? Oh yeah, sure, right, that's rich, ha ha, you're gonna make me rich! You see this book? (Marty ducks down again.) This book tells the future. It tells the events of every major sports event til the end of the century. Football, baseball, horse races, boxing...the information in here is worth millions, and I'm giving it to you. (He passes the book to 1955 Biff. Obviously 1955 Biff thinks this is a load crap.) Well, that's very nice, thank you very much. Now why don't you make like a tree and get out of here?
